Practice comparing different values
In the last two challenges, we learned about the equality operator (==) and the strict equality operator (===). Let's do a quick review and practice using these operators some more.

If the values being compared are not of the same type, the equality operator will perform a type conversion, and then evaluate the values. However, the strict equality operator will compare both the data type and value as-is, without converting one type to the other.

Examples

3 == '3' returns true because JavaScript performs type conversion from string to number. 3 === '3' returns false because the types are different and type conversion is not performed.

// Setup
function compareEquality(a, b) {
  if (10 === '10') { // Change this line
    return "Equal";
  }
  return "Not Equal";
  
}

compareEquality(10, "10");
console.log(compareEquality(10, "10"));
